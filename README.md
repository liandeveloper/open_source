# Open Source Analysis  

## Introduction  

Open-source software has transformed the way technology is developed and distributed. From operating systems like Linux to development tools like Visual Studio Code, open source has proven to be a driver of innovation and global collaboration. This project aims to analyze the open-source software ecosystem, exploring its evolution, trends, and the profile of the developers who drive it.  

# Methodology  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Use of APIs (e.g., GitHub API) to extract repository data.  
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing with Python (Pandas, NumPy).  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Trend visualization.  
   - Identification of patterns and correlations.  
3. **Tools**:  
   - Python (Pandas, NumPy).  
   - Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis.  
   - Streamlit.  

# Project Objectives  

1. Analyze trends in the use and adoption of open-source software.  
2. Identify the most popular open-source projects and their characteristics.  

### Heavy Hitters  

5. What are the characteristics of the most successful programs? How do they stand out from the rest and among themselves?  
   - How many stars do they have?  
   - How many forks do they have?  
   - What languages do they use?  
   - What licenses do they adhere to?  
   - Are they free or paid?  

### Developers  

6. Who are the most important committers/developers, and how do they stand out from the rest?  
7. What is the profile of an active/successful committer?  
   - How many followers, repositories, forks, and commits do they have?  
   - What kind of software do they develop?  
   - What language do they program in?  
   - Do they work collaboratively or independently?  
   - Are they affiliated with any organizations (educational institutions, companies, governments, etc.)?  
   - What are their income sources?  
   - Do they earn revenue from their work as open-source developers? If so, through what means?  

## Target Audience  

This is aimed at developers, data scientists, researchers, and companies interested in the advantages of open source, such as transparency, innovation, and cost reduction. It also appeals to educational communities and students seeking to explore its impact and practical applications in the tech industry.  

#### The project focuses on:  

- **Independent software developers**: To understand market trends and opportunities in the open-source ecosystem.  
- **Tech companies**: To identify key projects and talent in the open-source space.  
- **Governments and public organizations**: To evaluate the impact and adoption of open-source software in the public sector.  

# Data Sources  

#### **Open-Source Repositories**  

- GitHub API  

# Promotion Campaign  

- **Objective**:  
  - Raise awareness of the project's findings and their relevance to students, educators, and professionals interested in technology and data science.  

- **Social Media**:  
  - Publish visual summaries (infographics, short videos) highlighting the benefits of open source.  
  - Instagram: [@ds.open.source](https://www.instagram.com/ds.open.source/)  

- **Free Resources**:  
  - Offer an executive summary or downloadable guide with key conclusions.  
  - Share code examples or datasets used in the project.  

## History  

Open-source software has evolved from a fringe movement to a dominant force in the tech industry. From the creation of Linux in 1991 to the rise of projects like Kubernetes and TensorFlow, open source has demonstrated its ability to drive innovation and global collaboration. This history will be the central theme of our promotional campaign.  

## Video

A series of short documentaries exploring the history of open source, interviews with key developers, and an analysis of current trends, such as the economic impact of open source, success stories of notable projects, and the profile of the most influential developers.
